_The [Museum of Selfies](http://museumofselfies.tumblr.com) is a gallery of old paintings and ancient statues taking selfies._

It's interesting to see that a hand holding a smartphone can change the character of these old artworks and give their facial expression a whole new meaning.

You can submit your own selfies via email or Instagram with [#museumofselfies](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/museumofselfies).

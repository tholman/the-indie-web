_For a while now I've been contemplating creating an online space for sharing cool creative things online. I'd been a part of the awesome [creative.js](http://creativejs.com) team, while we were active and really enjoyed everything that was happening there... I also have a little bit of writers block when I try to get anything down. I've tried to tackle this, and a few other things with this blog. Hear me out!_

Actually, the little synopsis above doesn't nearly do this project justice. I'm trying to tackle a whole bunch of things here, let me list them out!

#### Getting into open source is hard.
I remember my first commit, that was merged into an open source project. I literally had no idea what was going on. I'd tried to read up on open source worked and came up fairly short. In the end, I was lucky that the repository owner was nice and helpful, and got my fixes in, in the end. It felt great.

It felt really great. I'd love this blog to be an opening point for new developers. If anything, just a little space to experience your first pull request, or first issue. First little taste of the amazing world they're about to get into.

#### Blogging is hard.
Inspiring Online isn't really about opinions, other than "This is cool!"... the articles are extremely short form. I guess I picked this up from Tumblr while working there. This helps get things out quickly and easily. I like moving that way.

At the very least, this could be a place where you commit one small thing in the morning... as though it's a "noncomplex" way to start the day. Sometimes, once I get commits rolling, I'm hard to stop. It feels great.

#### Community
I've really got no idea if this will be picked up or not, but ideally we can get a little crowd of people around this project, proposing new articles, and creating new little posts. Nothing too intense, but community would be nice!

...

I guess, these three points cover the majority of what I'm going for here. Please please please, check out the [contributing](https://github.com/tholman/inspiring-online#user-content-inspiring-online) page, and let me know what you think. Maybe even join in.

It literally can't hurt at all!
